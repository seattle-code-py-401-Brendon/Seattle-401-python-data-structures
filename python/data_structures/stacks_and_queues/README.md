<!-- Description of the challenge -->
### Feature Tasks Code Challenge Class 10
**Write the following methods for the Stack:**

- push
    - arguments: new value
    - adds a new node with the given value to the top of the stack
- pop
    - arguments: none
    - removes the topmost node and returns its value
- peek
    - arguments: none
    - checks what the top most node is, returns an exception if stack is empty
- isEmpty
    - arguments: None
    - Checks the top most node and returns a boolean depending if there is a stack or not

**Write the following methods for the Queue:**

- enqueue
    - arguments: new value
    - adds a new node with the given value to the front of the stack
- deqeueu
    - arguments: none
    - removes the front node of the queue and returns its value
- peek
    - arguments: none
    - checks what the front most node is, returns an exception if stack is empty
- isEmpty
    - arguments: None
    - Checks the front most node and returns a boolean depending if there is a queue or not

## Code
[Stack Code](./stack.py)
[Queue Code](./queue.py)

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->


## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->


## Unit Tests
- Can successfully add a node to the top/front of a stack/queue
- Can successfully remove a node from the top/front of a stack/queue  
- Can successfully peek the value of the top/front of a stack/queue
- Can successfully check if there is nothing in the stack/queue
